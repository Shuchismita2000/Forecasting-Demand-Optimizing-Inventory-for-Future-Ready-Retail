# SmartRetail AI: Forecasting Demand & Optimizing Inventory for Future-Ready RetailDynamic-Pricing

### Company Background:

**SmartRetail Corp.** is a national retail chain operating a network of mid-sized convenience stores across the country. Known for its wide assortment of household goods, groceries, and seasonal products, SmartRetail aims to provide excellent customer experiences while ensuring operational efficiency in its supply chain.

In recent years, SmartRetail has faced challenges due to fluctuating consumer demand, supply chain disruptions, and increased competition from both physical and e-commerce retailers. To stay competitive, SmartRetail has embarked on a data-driven transformation, leveraging AI and machine learning to optimize inventory management and pricing strategy.

### Business Challenges:

SmartRetail Corp. has collected extensive data from its stores including daily sales, inventory levels, pricing, local weather, holiday impact, and promotions. While the data is rich, the company struggles to make precise forecasts and real-time decisions. Key business problems they need to solve include:

1. **Inaccurate Demand Forecasts:**  
    Poor demand forecasting has led to frequent stockouts or overstock situations, directly affecting revenue and customer satisfaction.
    
2. **Inefficient Inventory Management:**  
    Static replenishment strategies have caused capital to be locked in unsold inventory, with high costs for warehousing and markdowns.
    
3. **Non-Responsive Pricing:**  
    Prices are set using static rules rather than real-time data, leading to missed revenue opportunities during peak demand periods or over-discounting during slow sales.
