
###  **Objective:**

Develop a dynamic pricing system that adjusts product prices daily (or in near-real time) based on demand forecasts, inventory levels, promotional cycles, holidays, and external factors like weather. The goal is to **maximize revenue** and **maintain healthy inventory turnover**, while considering customer sensitivity to price changes.

This empowers **SmartRetail Corp.** to respond rapidly to market conditions, optimize promotions, and reduce the risk of markdown waste.

###  **Key Features Used:**

- **Price**, **Discount Rate**
    
- **Units Sold** (to infer demand response to price)
    
- **Inventory Level**, **Forecasted Demand** (from Challenge 1)
    
- **Promotion Flag**, **Holiday Flag**
    
- **Category**, **Product ID**, **Store ID**
    
- **Weather Condition**, **Region**
    
- **Elasticity Indicators** (price vs. demand over time)

### **Methodologies:**

#### 1.  **Price Elasticity Modeling:**

- Estimate **how sensitive demand is to price changes** using regression models.
    
- Elasticity coefficient helps classify products:
    
    - **Elastic** (luxury, non-essential): High demand drop when price increases
        
    - **Inelastic** (essentials): Demand less affected by price
        

#### 2. **Predictive Models:**

- Build regression models to predict **expected revenue** or **units sold** based on:
    
    - Current price
        
    - Demand forecast
        
    - Inventory level
        
    - Time context (weekend, holiday)
        
- Models: XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest
    

#### 3. **Optimization Algorithms:**

- Use revenue = price × predicted quantity as an objective function.
    
- Constrain by:
    
    - Minimum/maximum price
        
    - Inventory availability
        
    - Category-specific rules
        
- Solve using:
    
    - Grid Search (for small cases)
        
    - Gradient-based optimizers
        
    - Integer or nonlinear programming
        

#### 4.  **Promotion Strategy Design:**

- Simulate markdown campaigns using forecast data
    
- Recommend start/end dates and discount tiers
    
- Track revenue lift vs. margin loss
    

#### 5.  **Reinforcement Learning (Advanced):**

- **States:** Price, inventory, demand forecast, days until expiry
    
- **Actions:** Set a new price (continuous or discrete levels)
    
- **Rewards:** Revenue or profit per episode
    
- **Algorithms:** Deep Q-learning, Actor-Critic, Contextual Bandits
    
- Ideal for environments where future demand impact of today’s pricing is critical (e.g., perishable items or flash sales)

- **Price Elasticity Coefficient**
    
- **Inventory Clearance Efficiency**
    
- **Units Sold Uplift** (compared to baseline pricing)
    
- **Customer Price Sensitivity Index** (if loyalty or return behavior is tracked)

###  **Expected Deliverables:**

- **Dynamic Pricing Engine:**
    
    - Recommends optimal daily price for each product-store pair
        
    - Integrates seamlessly with inventory and demand forecasts
        
- **Price Elasticity Dashboard:**
    
    - Visualizes how pricing affects demand for each product/category
        
- **Promotion Scheduler:**
    
    - Optimizes timing and depth of promotions based on forecasted uplift
        
- **Scenario Simulator:**
    
    - Allows managers to test hypothetical pricing strategies before implementation
